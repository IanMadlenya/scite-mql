{"name":"Scite-mql","tagline":"Alternate editor for your MQL files","body":"#Introduction\r\nAn editor based on scite-for-php and enhanced for MQL4 language. The goal is to be the de-facto editor in writing MT4 based code.\r\n\r\nCurrently it supports:\r\n - MQL syntax highlighting\r\n - Compiler integration\r\n - Auto-update MT4 upon compilation\r\n - Function listing\r\n - Autocomplete\r\n - Parameter hint\r\n - Help integration (press F1 on keyword brings up Help window)\r\n - Bracket matching\r\n - Block collapse / expand\r\n - Snippet, abbreviation support\r\n - Theming\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project is based on [scite-for-php](http://code.google.com/p/scite-for-php/) and partly on [scite-ru](http://code.google.com/p/scite-ru/) which both are based on [SciTE](http://www.scintilla.org). I added MQL4 support to it and although scite-for-php already supports a few languages such as C/C++/PHP/Javascript/HTML/CSS but this project will only target MQL specifically.<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n#Download\r\nAll new binary versions can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B5yYuvScBRONRkREWm9QdTVKMU0&usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n[What's changed](https://github.com/ylw633/scite-mql/blob/wiki/WhatsNew.md)\r\n\r\n\r\n#Screen Shots\r\nmore screen shots can be found <a href='https://github.com/ylw633/scite-mql/blob/wiki/screenshot.md'>HERE</a>\r\n![](http://wiki.scite-mql.googlecode.com/hg/images/scite-mql-s1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#FAQ\r\n**How do I compile the source?**<br/>\r\nThere are some [build instructions](https://github.com/ylw633/scite-mql/blob/wiki/BuildInstruction.md)\r\n\r\n**How do I switch theme?**<br/>\r\nOpen SciTEGlobal.properties and at the very bottom of the document it specifies which theme to become active, uncomment (remove #) to activate the theme of your choice, if you comment all the themes then default theme will be used.\r\n","google":"UA-33622941-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
